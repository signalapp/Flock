# Flock

A secure contact and calendar syncing application for Android.

Flock is a replacement for the default contact and calendar synchronization services provided by Google. Flock provides end-to-end encryption
between multiple Android devices putting the privacy of your contacts and calendars back under your control. To facilitate syncing between
multiple devices a "sync service" is required, this can be any standards compliant WebDAV server that conforms to the following RFCs:

1. RFC 2518 - HTTP Extensions for Distributed Authoring -- WEBDAV
2. RFC 4918 - HTTP Extensions for Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)
3. RFC 6352 - CardDAV: vCard Extensions to Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)
4. RFC 4791 - Calendaring Extensions to WebDAV (CalDAV)

Currently available on the Play store.
